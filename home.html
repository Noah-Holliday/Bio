Indianapolis is a great place to live, with a striving and fast growing technology field. Thousands of new technology jobs have surfaced in 
recent years, nearly doubling since 2010. Indy has scored over $7 billion in acqusitions and IPO's in mainly software companies over the last decade.
One of Indy's main challenges moving forward is a lack technology talent and it's inability to retain the talent it does generate; being one
of the main exporters of promising graduates. Luckily new programs have been popping up to remedy just this problem; programs such as Nextech that 
both cultivates and tries to retain said talent. They do this using a six week program which includes four weeks of back-end developing along 
with two weeks of commuity service and tours to show the value of staying.
