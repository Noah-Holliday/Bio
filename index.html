        <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
        <p>I don't have any fun and exciting hobbies like some people. For instance, I am not winning any competitions or gaining any awe from strangers. I often like to stay to myself when I spend my free time. And, my hobbies reflect that. Such as, I love to read, I can spend hours huddled up in a corner flipping pages without a care in the world, just enjoying the book and more importantly the silence. Some of my other hobbies include video games, biking, and cooking. </p>

        <h3>My Ambitions</h3>
        <p>My Main Ambition in life is to get myself into a position where I can support my family. However, I need this job to be mentally stimulating and satisifying to do. It is a goal shared by most of the population, but it is a goal nontheless. And, it is something that I strive to achieve everyday in some compacity or another.</p>

        <h3>How I got here</h3>
        <p>I have been pursuing the computer science field for three years. I started my first computer class freshmen year at Arsenal Technical High School. At the time I never thought I would be interested in computers, I didn't even decide to take the class. I was just automatically placed into the class and it was just another credit to me. However, throughout the year as we did fun and challenging activities I realized I could see myself doing this ten years from now. It was the first time I have ever felt something like that, and I have been pursuing it ever since.</p>
